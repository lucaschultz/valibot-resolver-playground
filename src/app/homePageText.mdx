# Valibot Resolver
 
Valibot is a new TypeScript schema validation library that offers type-safe validation with static type inference, a small bundle size of less than 300 bytes, and the ability to validate a range of data types from strings to complex objects. It is open source and has 100% test coverage. Valibot includes many transformation and validation helpers, and its source code is minimal, readable, and has no dependencies. Its well-structured API makes it a great choice for schema validation.

This example provides a first draft of a resolver to use Valibot with [React Hook Form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/resolvers). The example form is build using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. It [validates a Valibot schema](/schema) using a custom resolver, providing a playground to test if the resolver works correctly.

Have fun playing with it and let me know if you have any questions or feedback!
