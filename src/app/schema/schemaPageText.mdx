# The Schema

This is the schema validated in the example form:

```ts
import * as v from "valibot";

const formSchema = v.object({
  name: v.optional(
    v.string([
      v.minLength(2, "Name must be at least 2 characters."),
      v.maxLength(50, "Name must be less than 50 characters."),
    ])
  ),
  username: v.string([
    v.minLength(2, "Username must be at least 2 characters."),
  ]),
  email: v.string([v.email("Please enter a valid email address.")]),
  password: v.string([
    v.minLength(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters."),
    v.custom(
      (value) => value.match(/[a-z]/) !== null,
      "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter."
    ),
    v.custom(
      (value) => !value.match(/[A-Z]/) !== null,
      "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter."
    ),
    v.custom(
      (value) => value.match(/[0-9]/) !== null,
      "Password must contain at least one number."
    ),
    v.custom(
      (value) => !value.match(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/),
      "Password must contain at least one special character."
    ),
  ]),
});
```
